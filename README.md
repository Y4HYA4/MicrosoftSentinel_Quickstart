#  Sentinel Quickstart
I had a great time bringing value to businesses with Sentinel, and here I will try to assist you in getting started with integrating this tool into your business. Sentinel, in my experience, is excellent for increasing your employees' overall awareness and assisting in decision making.

I'll go over exactly what you should do to get started and get the value.

I wrote about it [here](https://github.com/Y4HYA4/Cloud_Blogs/blob/main/cl6capiny00cmfvnv9wwv9q1y.md), so read it before diving into the procedure. I provided an overview of the main components.
